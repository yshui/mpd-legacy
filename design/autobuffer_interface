Buffer plugin interface:
.seek:
	seek the stream, could request previous buffer to seek as well. If previous buffer is not seekable, seek fails.
	mpd will try to seek at the last seekable buffer


How to chain buffers:

<input plugin> -> [<input plugins> -> ] decoder -> [<filters> -> ] output

input chain example: curl -> zip -> rewind -> etc.

<input> is a producer only buffer
<output> is consumer only

others are both producer and consumer.

input and decoder should be seekable. if the last input plugin in chain is not seekable, rewind will be appended.

Buffer object:

buffer tags:

EOF tag: No buffer will come after this
SONGEND/SONGBEGIN tag: signal beginning/end of a song, for crossfade. songbegin tag will come with song metadata.
