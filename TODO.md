# Easy Tasks:
* Add support for Another Slight Atari Player (Currently used libgme is not good enough).

# Long Term Goals:
* (Possibly) get rid of GLib.
* DBus support.

# Possible alternatives to GLib functionalities
* Multithread -> Single thread (lots of works to be done)
* Async io -> libeio
* Event loop -> libev
* Other things -> we'll see
